      "3. **Guideline 3: Duration**\n",
      "   - The proposal mentions that the duration is 18 months.\n",

      "   - The proposal has mentioned that the methodology involves combining traditional methods with modern AI techniques, but lacks detailed information about the approach and methods to be used.\n",
      "   - Non-Compliance Reasoning: The proposal has not provided sufficient details about the methodology, which makes it difficult to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the research.\n",

      "   - The proposal has not specified the expected outcomes or deliverables of the research project.\n",

While the proposal has addressed some of the guidelines, it lacks essential information in other areas, such as the Principal Investigator's bio, methodology, expected outcomes, and budget justification.
